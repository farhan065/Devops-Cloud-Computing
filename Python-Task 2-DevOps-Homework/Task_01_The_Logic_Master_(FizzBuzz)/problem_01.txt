Task 1: The Logic Master (FizzBuzz)
Objective: Master conditional logic and loops.

Requirements:
Create a function named fizzbuzz_checker(limit).

The function should use a for loop to iterate from 1 to the limit.

Logic Rules:

If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".

If divisible by 3, print "Fizz".

If divisible by 5, print "Buzz".

Otherwise, just print the number itself.
