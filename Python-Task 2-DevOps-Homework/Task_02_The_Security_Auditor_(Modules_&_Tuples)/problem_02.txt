Task 2: The Security Auditor (Modules & Tuples)
Objective: Practice cross-file imports and using immutable data types.

Requirements:
Create scanner.py (The Module):

Define a Tuple named DANGEROUS_PORTS containing (21, 23, 445).

Create a function check_ports(active_ports) that loops through a list and prints a warning if a port is found in your DANGEROUS_PORTS tuple.

Create app.py (The Execution Script):

Import the scanner module.

Define a list of ports: [22, 80, 21, 443, 23, 8080].

Call the function from your module to audit the list.
